# Environmental-Analysis-of-Brazil-Weather
Repository dedicated to a project involving exploratory data analysis and data visualisation to analyse trends in Brazil's weather from the years 2001-2021 and using linear regression to create a rainfall forecasting tool which estimates the total monthly rainfall.

## Objective
Project objectives were to provide a report of the last two decades of weather change across Brazil and identify other countries with comparable weather characteristics.
In addition, identifying a list of areas in Brazil that would be suitable for harnessing wind power, for harnessing solar power and those which may require irrigation.
Finally, provide a tool to forecast the amount of rainfall in the future for an area that would be of interest to the local population.
